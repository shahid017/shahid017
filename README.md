### Hi there 👋
Data Scientist, ML and NLP engineer, working as Data Scientist in Five Rivers Technologies. I mainly use Python to perform these tasks.

🔭 To help my fellow Data Scientists, I have written a simple Python package SimpleEDA for Exploratory Data Analysis. I have written NlpHub which can perform basic NLP tasks easily.

🌱 In my ongoing learning quest, I am learning Django, Julia, and R. 

💬 You can ask for help about Data Science, ML and NLP.
